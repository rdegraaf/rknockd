rknock
======

This project is a challenge-response port knocking and SPA system that I wrote 
for my MSc in 2007.  It worked at the time.  It should compile under a modern 
compiler as of 2016, but it has not been tested and may not work.  I'm not sure 
that I remember how to use it.  It has various issues that need to be addressed 
before anyone should try to use it.

The design of this program is described in http://ciphertext.info/papers/thesis-degraaf.pdf 

Unless otherwise noted, all code here is currently not licenced for any re-use 
or distribution.  It is being made available for educational purposes only.
